    **A poetry collection that narrates a tale of blood, sweat, and bliss**

    In this evocative poetry collection, Kalvik delves deep into the emotional landscapes of depression, anxiety, love, longing, and gratitude. With a unique poetic style that blends lyric, free verse, and blackout poetry, each poem captures the rawness of the human experience in a world overwhelmed by hustle culture and the distractions of social media. 
    
    Amidst a backdrop of inner turmoil, the collection contemplates the search for a sustainable sense of self, offering moments of respite found in nature and the simple act of being present. A profound exploration of the delicate balance between despair and healing, this work is both a reflection and a refuge for those navigating the complexities of modern life.

    ## About the author

    Kalvik was born and raised in India, where his early years were shaped by a deep fascination with American culture and the promise of the "American Dream." At eighteen, he moved to the United States to pursue higher education, embarking on a decade-long journey in search of that dream. 
    
    In time, however, Kalvik discovered that the true essence of the dream was not something to chase but something to embody. Now a postdoctoral fellow at Texas A&M University, he spends his leisure time immersing himself in film photography, ballroom dancing, poetry, and the art of daydreaming.
