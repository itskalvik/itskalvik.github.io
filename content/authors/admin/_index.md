## About Me

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and robotics, with a focus on approximate inference (Bayesian learning) and path planning. Currently, I am investigating sparse Gaussian processes to tackle critical issues in robotics. These include generating explainable DNN predictions, sensor placement, multi-robot informative path planning, and robot motion planning.
